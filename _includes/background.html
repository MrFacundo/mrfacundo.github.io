    <p>
      In my <strong>four years</strong> of experience, I built UIs with essential libraries like <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Tailwind</strong>, as well as full-stack frameworks such as <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>. I also worked with core backend technologies like <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>Redis</strong> and <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>, focusing on clean architecture and maintainable code.
    <p>
      My academic background covers <strong>data structures, algorithms, porgramming patterns, network programming</strong>, and <strong>systems administration</strong>.
